# Introduction to **Vite**
A tool to quickly scaffold out a Vue 3 app
- An alternative to Vue cli, it does not use webpack to bundle code, instead uses native **ES** module **imports**, this results in **Vite** being much faster, specifically in boot time for your dev server and for hot module replacement.
```console
npm init vite-app app-name
```
